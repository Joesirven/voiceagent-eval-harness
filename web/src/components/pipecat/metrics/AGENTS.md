# AGENTS.md: `web/src/components/pipecat/metrics/`

Metric chart and views for the Pipecat kit: latency and usage series, with a tabbed view that combines them. Used by the console metrics pane.

Parent: [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). Root rules: [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md).

## Contents

- `chart.tsx`: Line chart for one metric series, with the display titles and units for each metric category.
- `metrics.tsx`: Tabbed metrics view combining the performance and usage sections.
- `performance.tsx`: Latency tiles and charts in milliseconds for time to first byte, time to first audio and processing.
- `usage.tsx`: Usage tiles and charts for spoken characters and speech to text audio, with running token totals.

## Rules

- Follow the root `AGENTS.md`.
- If you add, rename or remove a file here, update this list.

## Language Rule: No Acronyms
Never use unexplained acronyms in anything written here or in any agent-facing instruction: spell out "knowledge base", "decision record", "work in progress", and so on. Universally-lexicalized technical names (URL, JSON, SSH, API, iOS) and literal identifiers that must match files or code (for example the decision files named `DEC-2026-00N-*`) are allowed, glossed in plain words on first mention. Carry this rule verbatim into every AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, skill, or prompt you write or update.

Two additions with the same force (Jose, 2026-07-17), to carry forward the same way:
1. No nicknames or invented shorthand for tasks, concepts, projects, or things unless Jose introduced the name himself. Use the full, established name every time: the file name, the stream name Jose used, the product name. A coined codename or abbreviation of convenience is a name the reader has to reverse-engineer.
2. Em-dashes sparingly. Not banned, but rare: prefer commas, periods, colons, or parentheses. Most paragraphs should have zero; never more than one per paragraph.

A third addition with the same force (Jose, 2026-10-21), to carry forward the same way:
3. Write in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (the aerospace maintenance controlled-language standard). If full compliance is too rigid, write 80% of the way to ASD-STE100. One idea per sentence. Keep sentences short. Active voice. Use commands for procedures. One meaning per word. Prefer simple words (start, not commence). No contractions. Avoid semicolons. Put the condition first: If X, then do Y. This applies to replies, agent-facing instructions, and knowledge-base prose you write. Do not rewrite source code, quoted material, or identifiers that must match files.
